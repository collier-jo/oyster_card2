#test

- `top_up` should raise an error when the balance goes over 90

- in_journey?
  - when created its false

- touch_in
  - changes in_journey to true
  - raises an error if already on a journey
  - changes entry_station  to true 

- touch_out
  - changes in_journey to be false
  - raises an error if not on a journey
  - changes to nil 

- entry_station = nil 

- When a new station is being created
